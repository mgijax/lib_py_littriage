# Name: HttpRequestGovernor.py
# Purpose: provides a class for managing the frequency with which we can make HTTP requests,
#    to ensure a configurable amount of "niceness" when reading from other sites
# Notes:
#    1. The initial version of this library is intended to meet the needs for working with
#    the PLOS API, which has limits on the number of requests per minute, hour, and day.  It
#    should, however, be directly applicable for other sites as well.
#    2. This library is only intended to manage the request frequency within a single Python
#    process.  If you use this library in multiple processes, they are wholly unaware of each
#    other's traffic.
# Usage: Instantiate an HttpRequestGovernor object, overriding any default parameters desired,
#    then use the get() method to pass along the URL for the next request.  The governor keeps
#    track of the various timings and will sleep until it's okay to issue another request.
#    You can also ask the governor to report on its statistics so far.
