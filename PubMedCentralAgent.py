# Name: PubMedCentralAgent.py
# Purpose: provide an interface to various services at PubMed Central
# Usage: 
#	1. Initialize the module by calling setToolName() and/or setEmailAddress() as desired to override
#	default settings.
#	2. Instantiate an IDCoverterAgent (to convert DOI IDs to PMC IDs) or a PDFLookupAgent (to take
#	PMC IDs and look up)
#	3. Run with it.
